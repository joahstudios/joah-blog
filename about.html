    <h2>✿About✿</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is JoAnn, and I am currently based in Seattle, WA. I'm inspired to create all things that make my heart feel warm and fuzzy. This blog is my personal (yut public!) journal where I share my thoughts and art + sometimes some music that inspired me ☻
   </p>
    <p>  JoAh comes from a blend of my name, <i>JoAnn</i>, and the Korean word "joah" (좋아) which means <i>to like, to love, or to enjoy</i>. It perfectly captures the essence of this space ✿ a collection of everything I cherish and feel deeply connected to. </p>
    <p> I find inspiration in everything I see and feel. My muses are people I love - my family, friends, pets, and even romantic relationships that fill my heart.  </p>
