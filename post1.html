      <h2>The Gold(en) Fish 𓆝 𓆟 𓆞</h2>
      <p><small>Posted: May 15, 2025</small></p>

     <p>In Korean culture, we have something called <strong>taemong</strong>, or "birth dream." It’s a dream believed to predict conception, often experienced by the birth mother or someone close to her. For my taemong, my mom dreamt of an ethereal, sparkly, colorful fish swimming toward her. Maybe that’s why she gave birth to a girl who adored <em>The Rainbow Fish</em> growing up, who loves wearing bright, colorful clothes, and who surrounds herself with vibrant things.</p>

      <p>Of course, not everything can be tied to a dream, but I’ve always felt that my love for fish stems from that moment. I’m drawn to aquariums and even to the small tanks at the Thai restaurant down the street. Fish feel like kindred spirits. Sometimes I imagine myself as one, floating in the ocean—half present, half distant—letting the current decide my path, with no fixed destination. Other times, I feel like a goldfish in a small tank that seems infinite, or like a salmon navigating long distances that somehow feel fleeting.</p>
